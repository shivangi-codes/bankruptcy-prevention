# Bankruptcy-prevention
Data science-based project to predict and prevent bankruptcy 

Business Objective:

This is a classification project since the variable to predict is binary (bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy). The goal is to model the probability that a business goes bankrupt from different features.
The data file contains 7 features from about 250 companies.
The data set includes the following variables:

1.	industrial_risk: 0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk.
2.	management_risk: 0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk.
3.	financial flexibility: 0=low flexibility, 0.5=medium flexibility, 1=high flexibility.
4.	credibility: 0=low credibility, 0.5=medium credibility, 1=high credibility.
5.	competitiveness: 0=low competitiveness, 0.5=medium competitiveness, 1=high competitiveness.
6.	operating_risk: 0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk.
7.	class: bankruptcy, non-bankruptcy (target variable).
